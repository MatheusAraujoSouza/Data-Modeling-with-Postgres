# Data-Modeling

 ## introduction 

 A startup called Sparkify wants data analysis they provide by collecting on music and user activities in your new music streaming app.

The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what music users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON records about user activity in the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on songs in their app. They would like a data engineer to create a postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries in music playback analysis and bring it into the project. 

## Project Description

Getting Started To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a stellar schema for a given analytic focus and write an ETL pipeline that
transfers data from files in two local directories to these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

 note: the entire project was done with python.
